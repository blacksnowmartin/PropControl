Help me design a system a rental property owner can track tenants in his house whether a house is vacant or not, enable to create entry of tenant , view the entries of the tenants , enable him to modify the entries and also a feature of deleting them... When viewing the entries the owner should be able to view the status of how the payments have been done.
The system is supposed to direct tenant on how to pay the rent.... Through which the system will prompt the STK to do a MPesa payment where the money goes to the bank account straight away.

Firstly we focus on the owner administrator privileges then later how the tenant will be interacting with the system.

Later on incorporate Report logs.
